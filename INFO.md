## Pitt Global Ties Mentor Program
I decided to apply to be an Global Ties Student International Mentor for next semester at Pitt. Throughout the interviewing process, I was made aware of experiences and stresses that international students face when they first arrive in a new country. I am very outgoing and always love to meet strangers, especially from other countries to learn about their culture and language. This app idea is not only to ease the stresses off of international students trying to make friends with the native students, but also a way to encourage native students to spend their free time effectively by making friends with similar hobbies/interests.

## What it does
This application offers domestic and international students to create profiles and make events based off of categorized activities. Users can choose their skill level in activities to show on their profile and view events that are related to activities they liked.

## How we built it
Front-end: Vue.JS Back-end: flask + sqlAlchemy Others: Axios, redux, Webpack, Babel Logos and Art were retreived from flipicon.com

## Challenges we ran into
CORS: Proxy user requests from front-end to back-end. Component styling uniformity for different group mate with different backgrounds in CSS and HTML. Database mapping from user to activity: many to many relationship

## What's next for TureMe
Creating an iOS/Android application and adding a group messaging feature that members who are RSVP'd for an event can message each other before the event. Eventually have an algorithm for people to be suggested for events based off of which category the event is in and the activities they selected to be featured on their profile.

## Built With
> node.js, vue.js, javascript, html, css
